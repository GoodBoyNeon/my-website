        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello World! welp, seems I code little too much... anyways, I'm GoodBoyNeon, a programming nerd actually. I
            am currently in high school. As others, my future dream is to become a software engineer. I am currently
            learning html and python, very beginner in css and pretty good at javascript.<br>
            <br>
            I started off as a
            discord bot developer. I had that one curiosity about coding that led me here. Currently, I am working on
            several personal peojects like this site and some team projects I am intrested in. The way I came to this
            point is pretty interesting... not gonna tell you tho, good luck roaming around with the
            curiosity.<br>
            <br>
            Wanna know my experince in programming? well this is the right paragraph! So as mentioned
            above, I started as a discord bot developer, slowing getting better at node.js and javascript. After that I
            explored teh depths of coding industry to come across web development, game development etc. I really got my
            interest in it, learned few things and started writing the first lines of code for my first website. It all
            felt like magic how everything can be displayed on the internet from few letters... and then, I'am here!
            Gosh my fingers pain, can't type more... I'mma go sleep, good night! ðŸ’¡ ... Alright, it's morning, it was
            too early, right? anyways I'mma continue working on this section.<br>
            So I started programming at late 13, I really had that dedication to change the world... it all started with
            me imagining the actual magic I could do with just some keyboard presses. Writing the first lines of code of
            my discord bot from a tutorial from freecodecamp.org, I still remember that guy. I learned the most basics
            of javascript from some youtube tutorials, and rest from courses and self-projects.<br>
            <br>
            After around 3 months of me getting started, I had an erge to do a project with team, but wasn't good enough
            to act as the team
            leader, so I began searching for projects I can do, coinsidently, a discord bot support server wanted some
            developers for their new bot, I immidiately applied and got accepted too! I worked for the project and ngl
            the people in the team were suprisingly too good at programming, they just made syntaxs and commands that
            took me about an hour just to understand. That project was a golden chance that I took full benifits of.<br>
            <br>
            I got that much for today, dunno when I'mma update that... Thanks for reading!
